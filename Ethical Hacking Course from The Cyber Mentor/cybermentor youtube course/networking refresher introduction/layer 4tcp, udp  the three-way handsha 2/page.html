<title>Layer 4:TCP, UDP &amp; the three-way handshake</title>
</head><body><span style="font-size: 17pt">transport layer of the OSI model<br/>
TCP: Transmission Control Protocol<br/>
its a connection oriented protocol<br/>
this protocol is best suited for higher reliability<br/>
<br/>
UDP: User Datagram Protocol<br/>
its a connectionless protocol<br/>
<br/>
Scanning both tcp and udp as a penetration tester:<br/>
<br/>
Usually you just use TCP for scanning, and scanning is a important process<br/>
<br/>
TCP works on what is called a three-way handshake<br/>
Three-way handshakes:<br/>
1. Send out a SYN packet<br/>
2. Recieve back a SYN ACT packet<br/>
3. Last send a ACT packet <br/>
<br/>
explain:<br/>
think of it as an iteraction, like you have a friend or a neighber, you go to your neighber and say hello, that's sending a SYN, then your friend wave back that's receiving a back a SYN ACT packet, then you know you can start making conversations so you send your acknowledge, meaning you are sending back a ACT backet.<br/>
<br/>
PORTS:<br/>
Different protocols have different ports: for ex, http is over port 80, https is over port 443<br/>
<br/>
the process of getting connected to a website for example<br/>
say we are connecting to the port 443<br/>
and first we send a SYN packet, say i want to connect to you on port 443<br/>
and if port 443 is available and opeen for connection,<br/>
they will send back a SYN ACT packet, like saying: you can go ahead and connect me,<br/>
when you want to actually establish that connection, you'll have to send the acknowledgement pack<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
NEW TOOLS: Wire shark, this is built into kali linux, it can record what you send and what you receive and port knowledge and stuff. Will be more useful in the scanning section.<br/>
