Skype because of NAT on personal devices, have rendezvous or relay servers to do that, <br/>
&nbsp;NAT is kinda like a shield, that you can use, to send out request and get them, but others are unable to send request to you<br/>
<br/>
so Skype use relay servers to make client A and client B connect<br/>
<br/>
Client A and client B opens their connection to the relay server, than send datas to the server, then server exchange their informations and datas through the connection A and B opened.<br/>
