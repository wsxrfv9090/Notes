<title>Primitives vs. Objects in Practice</title>
</head><body><img src="image.png" /><br/>
resolving the problem from the last course.<br/>
by using a function called Object.assign()<br/>
this function assigned the jessica object completely into a new object{} and the value of returning was passed on to the new const jessicaCopy variable.<br/>
<img src="image 2.png" /><br/>
this was the outcome<br/>
it creates a new address<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
there are still other problems, which is that you can't use this in a object thats within another object.<br/>
So this is the shallow copy. Cause this only solve the problem on the first level.<br/>

To actually do that we need the deep cloning, which will be in later sections.</body></html>
