<title>An High-Level Overview of JavaScirpt</title>
</head><body>High-Level:<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Low-Level languages: Munually Manage All the Recources from CPU and memory.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; High-Level languages: These languages have so called abstractions that can take away those works.<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Down side is that these high-level languages such as Python and JavaScript will never be as fast and as optimized as low-level languages such as C.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Garbage-Collection:<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;This is a algorithms that belongs to one of the functions that were in high-level languages that can help developers to aside the memory management and do the main coding.<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;It automatically removes old and unused objects from the computer memory, in order not to clog it up with unnessasary stuff. <br/>
&nbsp;&#09;It automatically cleans the memory from time to time so we don't have to do it manually in our code.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Interpreted or just-in-time compiled:<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Multi-paradigm:<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;A paradigm is approach and an overall mindset of structuring our code which will ultimately direct the coding style and technique in a project that uses a certain paradigm.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;Imperative vs. Declarative<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Three popular paradigms:<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;&#09;&#09;Procedual Programming:<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;Organizing the code in a very linear way.<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;&#09;&#09;Object-oriented Programming:<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;&#09;&#09;Functional Programming:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Prototype-based object-oriented:<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Almost everything in JavaScript is an object, expect for primitive values.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First-Class Functions:<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Functions are treated as Variables, which is easy to use and can save lots of time while programming.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dynamic:<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;We don't assign variable types.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Single-Threaded:<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Concurrency Model: <br/>
&nbsp;&#09;&#09;Means that JavaScript Handles multiple tasks at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Non-Blocking Event Loop:<br/>
