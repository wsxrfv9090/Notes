<br/>
writing in javascript for web browsers requires that you give some careful thought to how your javascript will ultimately be consumed and who your targets are.<br/>
and that definitely means that you're gonna have to take the consideration the fact that some people will be using older web browser<br/>
yet writing javasript on a web server using framwork like nod.js, is a bit easier because you'll have some upfront knowledge about where that code will ultemately be executed.<br/>

in this course we'll be using nod.js as a lightweight means of executing little tiny javascript examples that we're going to create throughout this course </body></html>
