#1 declaring python2<br/>
#2 Importing modules: sys, socket<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the socket module allows us to connect over these two sockets: <img src="image 2.png" />, <img src="image 3.png" /><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Which is basiclly an ipv4 and a port.<br/>
#5 buffer is a string with a handred "A"s in it.<br/>
#9 Sending a connection<br/>
#10 To this Ip and this port<br/>
#11 And we are sending a message + that a handred "A"s<br/>
#12 Close that connection<br/>
#13 Sleep for a second<br/>
#14 Buffer becomes two handred "A"s<br/>
and it'll repeat over and over again from #9 to #14, as long as the connection works.<br/>
<br/>
and if we break this program, which is what fuzzing is anticipated to do,<br/>
#17 will print out where we crashed it, and how big is the buffer in terms of bytes.<br/>
and then #18 close out</body></html>
