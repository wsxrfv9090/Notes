<title>Common Ports and Protocols</title>
</head><body><img src="image.png" /><br/>
<br/>
FTP is File Teansfer Protocol, in some assessments it will show up, and its common when we do a thing called capture the flag, <br/>
it means we can log in to the server, we can put a file or we can get a file off the server<br/>
<br/>
SSH and Telnet kinda play hand in hand, <br/>
Telnet is the ability to log in to a machine remotely,<br/>
SSH does the same thing,<br/>
the only difference is that ssh is the encrypted version of Telnet<br/>
<br/>
SMTP and POP3 and IMAP<br/>
they are all related to mail, <br/>
<br/>
DNS: Domain Name System<br/>
is a way to resolve ip addresses into names, <br/>
like google.com, if you type google in the machine, and with DNS the computer knows oh you want to go to the ip address xxx;xxx;xxx;xxx<br/>
<br/>
HTTP AND HTTPS<br/>
that is website, and http is the non-secure version of the protocol,<br/>
https is encrypted<br/>
<br/>
SMB or Samba<br/>
probably the most common ports, as a pen tester<br/>
these relate to file shares,<br/>
<br/>
and from pen tester prospective, you have to think about all the carzy exploits we have we've had regarding smb<br/>
the most recent one up to the date 2022 01 as of the course &nbsp;was the wannacry virus or eternal blue or ms-17010<br/>
this expoit utilized an smb expoit to navigate through networks so it became very visious very quick because smb is opened so frequently on networks<br/>
<br/>
DNS<br/>
<br/>
DHCP:<br/>
DHCP associates you with an ip address kind of random<br/>
<br/>
TFTP:<br/>
its trivial ftp, it utilizes udp instead of tcp<br/>
<br/>
SNMP:Simple Network Management Protocol<br/>
<br/>
