<title>Concept of Complexity of time and space</title>
</head><body>Complexity of time:<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;some algorithms made some operations on constant, and the total sum of constant operations is the determinant of the Complexity of time<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;for example some algorithms used aN^2 + bN +c, then it's a O(N^2) type of algorithms in terms of complexity of time<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br/>
Complexity of space:<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;some algorithms used mutiple spaces to store variables.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;and if you only used one variable, its a O(1) type of algorithms in terms of complexity of space.</body></html>
