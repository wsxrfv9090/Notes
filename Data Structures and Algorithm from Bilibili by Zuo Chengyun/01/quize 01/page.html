(1) :<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One number in an array appeared only odd times, other numbers appeared even times, what is the odd number<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;requirements: Use the complexity of time: O(N)<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Use the complexity of space: O(1)<br/>
<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">int eor = eor ^ (every elements in the array)</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">then eor is the odd number, because a ^ 0 = a; b ^ b = 0; these two rules.</li>
</ul>

(2):<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Two number in an array appeared only odd times, other numbers appeared even times, what are the odd numbers<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; same requirements as (1):<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;int eor = eor ^ (every elements in the array) = a ^ b<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;{ explain: every other elements appreared even times so after the operation they'll all just be zero, and in the end it'll just left a &amp; b)<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; int eor' = eor' ^ every elements that at some digits of the numbers are 1 or 0 = a or b<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;{ explain: we know that a &amp; b are different, so a ^ b != 0; then they have at least one digits in their binary codes that are different, and that means<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;one of them would be 1 and the other would be 0 at the same position. and after the operation, all the other elements appeared even <br/>
&nbsp;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;times so they just be 0 again, but this time, on that digit it's going to be left with only a or b:<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;for ex: a: 10011<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09; &nbsp;b: 10010<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09; &nbsp;we make eor' = eor' ^ every elements that have the fifth digits placed as 1,<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09; &nbsp;then the eor' = a ^ .........<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09; &nbsp;and since other numbers appeared even times, they'll all just be one.<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09; &nbsp;therefore the eor' will just be a in this case<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;the final answer is:<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;first odd number is eor'<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;second odd number is eor' ^ eor.<br/>

this is genius btw.</body></html>
